# OOPinPy
### Welcome to my OOPinPy repo! This exists because I want to document my educational journey learning Python programming.
### To begin this journey I took a course called Object Oriented Programming Methods in Python, taught by Professor Eric Reed.
### In 11 developments, you will find what I built in this course -- a tool to analyze air quality using Purple Air's database.
