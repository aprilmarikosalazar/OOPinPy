## Object-Oriented Programming Project in Python

Hello! This repo exists to document the beginnings of my journey tinkering with Python.

To see what I built in 11 developments from scratch, click [here](https://github.com/aprilmarikosalazar/OOPinPy/blob/main/OOPinPy/Eleven.py) for the main script -- this tool analyzes air quality of the area(s) of your choice using Purple Air's DB. Feel free to run it using Colab [here](https://github.com/aprilmarikosalazar/OOPinPy/blob/main/tool_airqualanalysis.ipynb).

\* Acknowledgements: Of course, all the gratitude to [Eric Reed](https://github.com/csericreed) for never making me feel stupid.
