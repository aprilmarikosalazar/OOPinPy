# Journey into PyProg
### Welcome to my repo / Python portfolio! This exists because I want to document my educational journey learning Python programming.
##### To facilitate this, I'm taking a course series taught by Professor Eric Reed, offered in three parts. It is an understatement to say that this have been both challenging and rewarding.
####### For part 1, I learned "Object Oriented Programming Methods in Python" (titled OOPinPy). In 11 developments, you will find a program I built from scratch -- it's a tool to analyze air quality using Purple Air's database. Feel free to run it!
####### For part 2, I'm learning "Intermediate Software Design in Python" (titled ISDinPy). In 11 developments, you can follow my progress as I build a fully working Neural Network from scratch!
