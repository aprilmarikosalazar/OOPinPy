## Object-Oriented Programming Project in Python

Hello! This repo exists to document the beginnings of my journey tinkering with Python.
In 11 developments, you will find [this tool](https://github.com/aprilmarikosalazar/OOPinPy/blob/main/OOPinPy/Eleven.py) I built from scratch -- it analyzes air quality of whatever area you select (using Purple Air's database). Feel free to run it using Colab [here](https://github.com/aprilmarikosalazar/OOPinPy/blob/main/tool_airqualanalysis.ipynb).

Acknowledgements: Of course, all the gratitude to [Eric Reed](https://github.com/csericreed) for never making me feel stupid.
